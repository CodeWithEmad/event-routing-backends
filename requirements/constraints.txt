# Version constraints for pip-installation.

# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints
# that will be applied if a package is needed.
#
# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why.  Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.

# code-annotations currently restricts to Django<2.3
Django<2.3

# tox==3.20.0 currently pins importlib-metadata to < 2 which breaks make upgrade beacuse a newer version is available.
# This can be removed once we no longer need to support python 3.5
importlib-metadata==1.7.0
